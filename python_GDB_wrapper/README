Workflow 

    1. User calls gdb with -wrapper option, in which the wrapper is setup.py, to generate a gdbinit file. 
    2. User calls gdb and passes the generated gdbinit file 
    3. User has more fun debugging! :D 

    setup.py should: 
        1. extract args and exec info to populate gdbinit 
        2. Ask user to quit or continue if possible. If continued then we iterate to the next called exec and repopulate gdbinit

Example

    1. example_wrapper.sh contains an example of how to use the setup.py wrapper 

Pitfalls

    1. GDB complains that your gdbinit file is not safe to load. There are several ways to deal with this. 

    One way to resolve this is to add "safe" paths to one's ~/.gdbinit file
        e.g.    
            add-auto-load-safe-path /home/Dev/DebugMe/.gdbinit
    
    RTFM, if you want other ways to deal :3
